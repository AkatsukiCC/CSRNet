# CSRNet

## Datasets
ShanghaiTech Dataset: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16dhJn7k4FWVwByRsQAEpl9lwjuV03jVI)

## Models

We strongly understand that it's tedious and difficult to config a custom input layer (even installing CAFFE on your own PC), thus we decide to make a pytorch version for the csrnet:)

Well it's too slow to upload the model to google drive:(
