## Datasets
ShanghaiTech Dataset: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16dhJn7k4FWVwByRsQAEpl9lwjuV03jVI)

## Models (Only for tests)

This is the model for test. The results should be similar to the results shown in the paper(slightly better or worse).

2) ShanghaiTech_Part_B: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NOpn0ztlye85vrHR2TMwOI2Qu_S8zANj)

## Prerequisites

1) A good CAFFE

We understand that it's tedious and difficult to config a custom input layer (even installing CAFFE on your own PC), thus we decide to make a pytorch version for the csrnet:)
